      <h2>Below are a few post about my week last week</h2>

      <h3>Things I ate</h3>
        <p>January 2nd: There was an old shoe in the garage. I don't like the taste of leather</p>

      <h3>Going to the vet </h3>
        <p>January 4th: I went to the vet because I ate a shoe and it didn't end well. Here is some advice the vet gave me:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't eat shoes.</li>
          <li>Rest</li>
          <li>Drink plenty of water</li>
